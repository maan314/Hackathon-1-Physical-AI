# Embodied Control & Middleware

## Introduction to Embodied Control

Embodied control refers to the design and implementation of control systems for physical agents that interact with the real world. Unlike traditional control systems that operate in simulation or on abstract data, embodied control systems must handle the complexities and uncertainties of the physical world.

## Middleware for Robotics

Middleware provides the communication infrastructure that allows different components of a robotic system to interact seamlessly. In the context of embodied AI, middleware must handle:

- Real-time communication requirements
- Sensor and actuator integration
- Distributed system coordination
- Fault tolerance and error handling

## Key Concepts

- **Real-time constraints**: Physical systems have strict timing requirements
- **Uncertainty handling**: Sensors provide noisy data, actuators have limitations
- **System integration**: Multiple components must work together reliably
- **Safety considerations**: Physical systems can cause damage if not properly controlled

## Next Steps

In the next chapter, we'll explore the specific communication patterns used in ROS 2 for implementing embodied control systems.
