# Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook, a comprehensive guide to bridging the digital brain (AI models & agents) with the physical body (robots, sensors, actuators) using simulation-first, sim-to-real methodologies.

## About This Textbook

This textbook is designed for students and researchers interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics. It follows a structured approach from Digital → Simulated → Embodied → Autonomous, providing both theoretical foundations and practical implementation guidance.

## Course Structure

The textbook is organized into 5 modules, each containing 4 chapters:

1. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Embodied Control & Middleware
2. **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Physics, Simulation & Interaction
3. **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - AI Integration & Transfer
4. **Vision–Language–Action (VLA)** - Multimodal AI & Safety
5. **Capstone — Autonomous Humanoid** - Full System Integration
