# Full Autonomous Demo

## Integration of All Capabilities

This capstone chapter demonstrates the integration of all capabilities developed throughout the textbook into a complete autonomous humanoid system. The goal is to showcase how individual components work together to achieve complex, autonomous behaviors.

## System Integration Challenges

Bringing together all subsystems requires addressing:

- **Timing coordination**: Ensuring all systems operate with appropriate synchronization
- **Resource allocation**: Managing computational and power resources across subsystems
- **Data flow management**: Coordinating information flow between components
- **Error propagation**: Preventing failures in one system from affecting others
- **Performance optimization**: Balancing performance across all integrated systems

## Autonomous Demo Scenarios

Example scenarios demonstrating full autonomy:

- **Home assistance task**: Navigate to location, identify and manipulate objects, return to base
- **Warehouse operation**: Locate items, plan paths around obstacles, perform manipulation tasks
- **Social interaction**: Recognize humans, navigate safely, engage in simple interactions
- **Search and rescue**: Explore unknown environments, identify targets, report findings

## Task Planning and Execution

Coordinating high-level autonomous behavior:

- **Goal specification**: Defining complex tasks for the autonomous system
