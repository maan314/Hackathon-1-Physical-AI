# 🤖 Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** is a full-stack monorepo project focused on bridging the **digital brain** with the **physical body**.  
It combines a **Docusaurus-based technical textbook (frontend)** with a **robotics/AI backend**, designed for research, education, and real-world robotic systems.

🧠 Frontend — Physical AI Textbook
Built with Docusaurus, the frontend provides a structured technical textbook covering:

🤖 Robotic Nervous Systems (ROS 2)

🧬 Digital Twins (Gazebo & Unity)

🧠 AI-Driven Perception & Control

🦾 Humanoid Robotics Architecture

🚀 Run Frontend Locally

cd physical-ai-humanoid-robotics
npm install
npm run start
Open:

http://localhost:3000
🏗 Build for Production

npm run build
⚙️ Backend — Physical AI & Robotics APIs
The backend is designed to support:

Robotics APIs

Simulation control

AI model integration

Future ROS 2 communication pipelines

▶ Run Backend (Example)

cd physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn src.main:app --reload
